        <h2>Our Legacy</h2>

        <h3 style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Ideally situated on the shores of Lake Iliamna, Angry Eagle Lodge & Outfitters is the perfect place to experience Alaskan fishing at its finest. </h3>

        <img class="floater" src="/_assets/img/pippens.jpg" alt="Jerry and Karen Pippen, founders of Rainbow Bay Resort"/>

		<p>Our story began in 1984, when Jerry and Karen Pippen founded Rainbow Bay Lodge. They quickly established it as one of Alaska’s premier, full-service fishing lodges, which also led to it being named as one of “The Top 25 Fishing Lodges in North America” by Field & Stream magazine. The Pippens managed the resort for nearly 30 years before the lodge changed ownership and was renamed Angry Eagle Lodge & Outfitters in 2013. </p>

		<p>Although our name has changed, our longstanding tradition of providing the ultimate Alaskan fishing experience remains the same. In addition to expanding our fleet of planes, boats, and ATVs, we've added Eagle’s Peak Lodge—a spacious lodge that overlooks Lake Iliamna.</p>

		<p>We continue to specialize in remote angling adventures for small groups of 12 to 14 clients per week at Angry Eagle Lodge and private groups of up to eight clients per week at Eagle’s Peak Lodge from early June through late September. Our wide selection of aircraft and boats allows us to access some of the most remote streams, lakes, and rivers from Lake Clark National Park and the Nushagak River to Cook Inlet and the Bering Sea. Our large fleet also helps us ensure clients can comfortably and safely fish on days when fly-outs aren’t possible due to the weather (a perk that many other area lodges can’t give their clients).</p>
