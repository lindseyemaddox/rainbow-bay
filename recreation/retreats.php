		<p>When’s the last time you looked up from a business meeting to see the splendor of Southwestern Alaska right outside your window?</p>

		<p>Escape from daily distractions of the office so you can focus on your company’s future by combining your next corporate getaway or group team building retreat with the experience of a lifetime at picturesque Angry Eagle Lodge & Outfitters in the heart of Southwest Alaska’s Bristol Bay region.</p>

			<li>Private space for group meetings</li>
			<li>Access to satellite television and high-speed wireless Internet</li>
			<li>Recreational activities, such as fly fishing, plane tours, boating, and hiking</li>
