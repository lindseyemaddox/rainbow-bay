		<h2 class="subh2">Lake Kayaking</h2>
		
		<p>Enjoy an afternoon or morning lake kayaking as you paddle along Southwest Alaska’s pristine shorelines of <span property="name">Lake Illiamna</span>. It is the largest lake in Alaska, eighth largest lake in the United States of America, and one of the largest in North America, covering about 1,000 sq. miles. The lake is 77 miles long and up to 22 miles wide, with a maximum depth of 988 feet. Through the Kvichak River, its waters drain into Bristol Bay. Designed for every skill level, this guided experience provides a unique perspective that allows you to get up close and personal with the local marine life—including many fish, waterbirds, eagles and perhaps the legendary Illiamna monster. We’ll provide all the needed equipment, and our friendly guides will be happy to teach you kayaking techniques before getting started.</p>
