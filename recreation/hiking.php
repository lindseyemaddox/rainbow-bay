		<h2 class="multiple subh2">Katmai National Park & Preserve</h2>

		<p>We provide plane tours to <span property="name">Brooks Falls</span> in Katmai National Park for bear viewing. The park is famous for its brown bear viewing platforms in the heart of the world's largest protected brown/grizzly bear population that’s estimated to be around 2,200 bears.</p>

		<p>We also provide plane tours to Richard Proenneke’s famous Twin Lakes homestead featured in PBS’ “One Man’s Wilderness.” This national park holds striking diamond-blue glacial lakes and some of the largest and remotest glaciers and mountain ranges in all of Alaska. It's also home to dall sheep, brown bear, moose, and wolverine as well as <a href="http://www.nps.gov/lacl/naturescience/bird-list.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">nearly 200 Alaska bird species</a>.
