  <img src="/_assets/img/staff-thurley.jpg" alt="Angry Eagle Operations Manager Rod Thurley">

	<p>Born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee, Rod is a first generation American.  His mother was from Scotland and he father was from England, which explains his lack of a strong southern drawl.</p>

	<p>Rod attended Purdue University and Middle Tennessee State University.  He raced off-road motorcycles professionally for 7 years while attending college and retired after 18 years of owning an RV dealership in Nashville.</p>

	<p>He brings a wealth of outdoor experience to the Angry Eagle Lodge between big game hunting and fresh and salt-water fishing experiences since a very young age.</p>

	<p>Personally, he has been married for 28+ years to his college sweetheart. He has 2 children, Hannah, who attends the University of Tennessee and Hunter, who attends the University of Mississippi. Both are Division 1 athletes and compete at the highest level. He has raised them like he lives his life, based on 2 simple rules: Do what is right and do the best you can do. </p>

	<p>Rodâ€™s hobbies include golf and motorcycling.  He is a registered hunting guide in New Mexico and spends the better part of September archery guiding and hunting elk and mule deer in the Rockies. He also enjoys spending time on both of his farms in Tennessee, is a diehard Tennessee Titans fan since they came to town and loves his family life.</p>
