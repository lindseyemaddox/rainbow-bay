  	<p>How does spending 12 years as a professional golfer lead to a career as a fishing guide? Just ask Jon Baker.

	<p>After dedicating the first half of his career to golf—including playing competitively, instructing, and working at PING—Jon decided to follow his passion for hunting and fishing while visiting Alaska during a pro golf event in 1993. He prolonged his stay to do some fly fishing, and it wasn’t long after that when he began hosting trips so others could experience Alaskan fishing firsthand. </p>

	<p>Even from a young age, Jon has loved nature and wildlife. He’s at home in the outdoors—it’s just part of who is. And with 20 years’ experience as a fishing and hunting guide, Jon is an invaluable resource to Angry Eagle and its guests. He’s met people from every corner of the world while teaching them everything he knows about hooking Alaska’s finest.</p>

	<p>And it’s safe to say he knows what he’s doing. His best catch is a tie between a 37.5-inch steelhead trout and a 50-lb. king salmon caught on a fly rod. Both fish took half an hour to land and went down river more 300 yards. In fact, many of his claims have earned a wide range of trophies for his impressive feats.</p>

	<p>When he isn’t guiding Angry Eagle guests, he’s busy organizing hunting and fishing adventures in North America, South America, and Africa.</p>
