  	<p>Derek Boschma grew up fishing the rivers of Washington and Oregon. Adventure and desire to experience the outdoors in the "Last Great Frontier" drove him to Naknek, Alaska. There, he first worked on the fishing docks in Bristol Bay. Eighteen-hour days filled with the “enjoyment” of pushing fish off of tender boats at 2am to feed the cannery workers was part of his normal duty day.</p>

  	<p>Eager for new opportunity, Derek made his way into the guiding industry. This is where he found his true calling: guiding fishermen/women in the Alaskan wilderness. For the past 10 years, he has dedicated his life to fishing and guiding on the many rivers and lakes in Southwest Alaska. Traditional fly fishing for Bristol Bay rainbows and coastal silver salmon are Derek’s preferred favorites--especially along world-renowned rivers, including the Copper, Gibraltar, Kamishack, and Iliamna.</p>

  	<p>When he is not fishing, you can find Derek up in the skies, navigating a floatplane in search of new sights and new fishing territory. Or, you'll find him perfecting new guitar licks or hunting waterfowl.</p>
