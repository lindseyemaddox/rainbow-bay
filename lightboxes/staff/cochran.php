  <p>Mason Cochran is passionate about the outdoors&mdash;particularly when it comes to fishing. That, combined with his love of teaching, is what makes him an outstanding Angry Eagle fishing guide.</p>

  <p>Regardless of their skill levels, guests can always count on Mason to provide assistance and teach them everything they need to know about various fishing techniques, such as how to safely catch and release fish. Simply put, he wants everyone to have memorable experiences, which is why he's happy to spend as much time as needed to ensure guests get their fishing techniques just right.</p>

  <p>"I love teaching guests about fishing," he said. "My most exciting fishing story is when I taught a man who had never fished how to fly fish, and I helped him catch rainbow trout in Knutson Bay."</p>

  <p>While Alaska offers a plethora of fishing opportunities, Mason says his favorites places are the Iliamna River, the Kulik River, and Mulligan Creek. If given his pick, you'd find him fly fishing for trout and grayling.</p>

  <p>And Mason's love of teaching and encouraging others goes well beyond fishing. When he's not at Angry Eagle, he's serving as an assistant wrestling coach at a local high school.</p>
