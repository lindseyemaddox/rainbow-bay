        <div class="description">
          <p><span>What: </span>Silver salmon are the salmon of choice by most avid fly fishermen. They average eight to 12 pounds with larger fish weighing in at 15 pounds or more.</p>
          <p><span>When: </span>These fish run from early August through September.</p>
          <p><span>How: </span>Whether you use a fly rod or spinning rod, this fish will live up to his fighting reputation. We fish freshwater streams within 200 yards of the ocean. In fact, the fish are so fresh from the ocean they still have sea lice.</p>
