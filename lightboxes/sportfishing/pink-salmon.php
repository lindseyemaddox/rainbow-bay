		  <h1>Pink Salmon</h1>

        <div class="description">
          <p><span>What: </span>Pink salmon typically measure 36 inches in length, often exceeding 30 pounds. Itâ€™s not uncommon to catch 100 fish a day, averaging three to five pounds apiece.</p>
          <p><span>When: </span>Pink salmon start their run in mid-July and taper off in mid-August. Historically these fish run in cycles of two years, but in the lower Cook Inlet area, we have fishable runs every year.</p>
          <p><span>How: </span>We fish for pink salmon in freshwater streams, right where they flow into saltwater. This ensures the strongest fish available. These salmon are extremely aggressive on light tackle, whether it be spinning or fly.</p>
