          <p><span>What: </span>Next to the king salmon, chum salmon are the biggest and strongest of all the salmon. They typically weigh between 15 and 18 pounds with larger fish weighing between eight and 10 pounds.</p>
          <p><span>When: </span>Chum salmon runs coincide with the pink salmon in our area.</p>
          <p><span>How: </span>We fish in the freshwater streams at the point where they flow into saltwater. Chum like shallow, fast-moving water and can give you all the fight you can handle on spin tackle. They can be a great starter for the novice fly fisherperson because of their eagerness to take a fly.</p>
