  <h1>Northern Pike</h1>

        <div class="description">
          <p><span>What: </span>Northern pike is a sport fish in a class by itself—it’s a true predator that will eat anything that doesn't eat it first. This fish averages five to 10 pounds with some reaching 20 to 30 pounds.</p>
          <p><span>When: </span>They are available throughout the summer.</p>
          <p><span>How: </span>Whether you’re using a popping cork bug, streamer on a fly rod, or a spoon on a spinning rod, it’s thrilling to see the water part as a big pike comes in for the kill.</p>
