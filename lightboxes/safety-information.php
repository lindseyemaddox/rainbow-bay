  <h1>Safety Information</h1>

  <p>You should be aware that there are inherent dangers and risks associated with any wilderness adventure, including but not limited to the hazards of:</p>

  <ul>
	<li>traveling in natural terrain,</li>
	<li>boating,</li>
	<li>traveling via aircraft, and</li>
	<li>sustaining accidents or developing illnesses in remote places without medical facilities and/or due to the forces of nature.</li>
  </ul>
